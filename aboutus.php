            <b>History</b><br>
                The idea of this project was quite simple. This scratched us on seeing rising prices of pharmecuticals.<br> The concept went hand in hand.
                Increase in prices also led to increase in demand for cheaper drugs/medicines. There is where we put light.<br> We came up with this idea of having
                a detailed study of all the drugs based on classification etc. and get the end product that is cheaper than the original one.
                <br>    Then comes the problem where to get the drug/medicine?? We have a handy solution to that as well. One tap and you have the nearest medical store with all its
                details. Want to know what all medicine's present in a store?? Here we go, we can a solution to all your problems.<br>
